Some C data structs and algorithms that I use or find interesting.

> *C and typesafety are like oil and water*

##Desiderata
I would be specially thankful for any advice that could be offered in regards to the following:
1. **Performant**: The structs and algs should be as efficient as they can, with a decent balance of runtime and memory. I'm also interested in the _fastest_ data structs for a given use case.
2. **EZ 2 Use**: The tools should be "comfortable" to use. To a reasonable extent, the tools should be written so that the user is not encumbered by verbose, boiler-plate code when they have to use them.
3. **Well-Documented**: All functions and structures should be documented. There should also be small explanations of how the code works and where one might find more information about the algorithm being used where relevant. 

###STRUCTS INCLUDED
Those marked with (u) are usable as of right now. They are all in constant improvement, however. 
- (u) A vector (as in a C++-style vector)
- (u) A Van Emde Boas Tree
- (u) A bitset
- (u) A doubly-linked list
- A hashtable
- A priority queue
- An Aho-Corasick automaton
- A stack and heap using a vector

###TO DO
- Documentation for already existing structs and funcs. 
- A hashtable (Hopscotch & Robinhood)
- A hashtable but concurrent (Hopscotch?)
- A priority queue (Fibonacci heap? Probably?)
- An attempt at a "generalized" Segment-Tree
- Aho-Corasick automaton
